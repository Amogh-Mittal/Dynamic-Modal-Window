### Disclaimer: This project is still in development and not fully feature-ready (with samples and enough options, though you can alter it to your needs.)

# Introduction
A fully dynamic modal window for unity engine. It works like an API, i.e., you create a popup Request and ask the popup Manager to show a popup with that request.
For placing the elements the popup manager uses the layout class passed to it through the popup request.

# Installation
For installing you can clone this repository, and then copy the Dynamic Modal Window folder to your project.
Or you can add a project for git url in the unity package manager window. Here's the URL:
https://github.com/Amogh-Mittal/Dynamic-Modal-Window.git
### Note: once this project becomes feature-ready I'll upload an asset on the asset store.

# Get Started
To get started, navigate to the Prefabs of the asset, and drag the Popup Canvas prefab in the scene.
Now you can acces the PopupManager and create popup requests.
